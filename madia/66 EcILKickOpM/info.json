He is a very popular person who has a reputation of being a great cosmologist.\nHe was born in 1942 in Oxford. \nStephen Hawking's credibility is based on opinion of many people.\nSome laypeople believe that Stephen Hawking's creative work is the forefront of science.\nThis is one point of view.\nBut there is another point of view on Stephen Hawking's creative work.\nIt is approximately as follows:    \nSince ancient times, fools are trying to invade our planet, and they've managed to capture Oxford.  \nAnd now Stephen Hawking is the leader of fools in this world.\nWhat are these two contrary points of view based on?\nStephen Hawking's followers believe that he is smart, because he was blessed by the Pope himself.\nObama once tried to strangle him. I'm sorry, in fact Obama was handing Mr. Hawking a medal.\nStephen Hawking's opponents believe that he was born in a year of a terrible crop failure and that he is a defective scientist because modern cosmology is based on a gross paralogism and can only dream of becoming a science. \nWhy do people disagree so much in their estimates?\nSimply because scientists and fools have different approaches to counting potatoes. \nLet's consider, what is right way to count potatoes?\nFirst of all, you need to pull yourself together and make sure that you are able to focus well enough to see the difference between potatoes and other objects. \nNow you need to remember that it is potatoes that you are counting. \nScientists count potatoes in a usual way. \nOne potato, two potatoes, three potatoes.\nIf they run out of the potatoes, scientists simply stop counting.\nAnd this kind of logic applies to everything.\nIt applies to counting potatoes and cabbage. And even when scientists are counting polar bears in the Arctic, they count bears only and never add polar explorers to the count. Nor they do the time spent in the Arctic while counting bears, or even body temperature of polar explorers' wives who didn't go to the Arctic. \n That is, scientists count only bears alone.\nIt is not customary for scientists to get confused.  \nAnd if they run out of the potatoes, scientists simply stop counting.\nAnd it makes sense, damn it...\nFools can't stop and go on counting in a following manner:\none potato, two potatoes, three potatoes, four alarm clocks, five corns, six callipers.\nAnd they will count this way for a very long time till they run out of pliers.\nWhy do they begin counting corn instead of potatoes? Or alarm clocks? Fools really do not understand why. It's a tradition. They were instructed by other fools to count in such a manner. As if everything in nature were interdependent. \nThe funniest thing though is that they can't count it all through. Hundreds of years ago, fools began counting alarm clocks and they are still counting them. They can't deliver the final result: what in fact do they get in the end?\n And Stephen Hawking counts potatoes like the most pedigreed fool.\nAll Stephen's scientific papers are based on such a way to count.   \nThey all begin lake that:  Let's take formulas that we got from a wrong way of counting potatoes.\nAnd in this amusing manner Stephen Hawking and his followers try to count dimensions of space.\nIt took them the whole century to count them and they are still not quite sure how many dimensions are there in space.\nAlthough scientists have counted everything about a 1000 times, checked it and then rechecked, and got a solid result of three!\nBy the way, that was not hard. Anyone can check. They are usually counted through a right angle.\nAnd if you do not mind a right angle you yourself can easily count, how many lines can one make through a right angle on flats and in space.\nThese are the dimensions.\none dimension\ntwo dimensions\nthree dimensions\n\nEach time through the right angle. \nSpace has exactly three dimensions. Let's check them: one, two, three.\nIt's exactly three.\nAnd there is a good reason to stop counting dimensions since they have been already counted and corns are not dimensions.\nAnd of course before they start counting, each","best_video":{"mimeType":"video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.64001e\"","contentLength":null,"size":null,"url":"https://rr3---sn-xn5ucu-q0cz.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1676879353&ei=mdHyY77eFsTqWe_TrOgB&ip=78.16.131.161&id=o-AC9CCFvyKnF8kWAgMufo7GJhm_Y1x5qpnLiOkeVqmY-W&itag=137&aitags=133%2C134%2C135%2C136%2C137%2C160%2C242%2C243%2C244%2C247%2C248%2C278&source=yt_otf&requiressl=yes&mh=Dj&mm=31%2C29&mn=sn-xn5ucu-q0cz%2Csn-q0c7rn7d&ms=au%2Crdu&mv=m&mvi=3&pcm2cms=yes&pl=21&initcwndbps=1897500&vprv=1&mime=video%2Fmp4&ns=Tu5wibi7eUqqgyXUtsHSGR8L&otf=1&otfp=1&dur=0.000&lmt=1461919228974205&mt=1676857259&fvip=1&keepalive=yes&fexp=24007246&c=WEB&n=-D-0zVZ4zBbw2A&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Caitags%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cns%2Cotf%2Cotfp%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AOq0QJ8wRQIhAMfF4-stCvRyaM6purA3nq2PGfZXw9-vp9vKPMedoQrRAiBIDrR7Ii2ODPbu1xxDZ1orDrMSS5egsgMCvaVXr6h9ew%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpcm2cms%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=AG3C_xAwRAIgOhTId8R6moaSA89uMBbjEtHs78YTGuXh1mE25g-04QsCIEHQlBktHl1Onv_GlLE8E4vuZGt3jSNfNmwzvCqxuXDG","fps":30,"width":1920,"height":1080},"worst_video":{"mimeType":"video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.4d400b\"","contentLength":null,"size":null,"url":"https://rr3---sn-xn5ucu-q0cz.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1676879353&ei=mdHyY77eFsTqWe_TrOgB&ip=78.16.131.161&id=o-AC9CCFvyKnF8kWAgMufo7GJhm_Y1x5qpnLiOkeVqmY-W&itag=160&aitags=133%2C134%2C135%2C136%2C137%2C160%2C242%2C243%2C244%2C247%2C248%2C278&source=yt_otf&requiressl=yes&mh=Dj&mm=31%2C29&mn=sn-xn5ucu-q0cz%2Csn-q0c7rn7d&ms=au%2Crdu&mv=m&mvi=3&pcm2cms=yes&pl=21&initcwndbps=1897500&vprv=1&mime=video%2Fmp4&ns=Tu5wibi7eUqqgyXUtsHSGR8L&otf=1&otfp=1&dur=0.000&lmt=1461919228974205&mt=1676857259&fvip=1&keepalive=yes&fexp=24007246&c=WEB&n=-D-0zVZ4zBbw2A&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Caitags%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cns%2Cotf%2Cotfp%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AOq0QJ8wRQIgSrPJhtHbsHgwnQrAUjQUwfwj43U7LkEaxrweCZO-H1QCIQCWzNu_IQX1t83F_Tt68yijJL3aJEhw_ak6CZVaLUdMsw%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpcm2cms%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=AG3C_xAwRAIgOhTId8R6moaSA89uMBbjEtHs78YTGuXh1mE25g-04QsCIEHQlBktHl1Onv_GlLE8E4vuZGt3jSNfNmwzvCqxuXDG","fps":30,"width":256,"height":144},"worst_audio":{"mimeType":"audio/mp4; codecs=\"mp4a.40.2\"","contentLength":24028152,"size":"23MB","url":"https://rr3---sn-xn5ucu-q0cz.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1676879353&ei=mdHyY77eFsTqWe_TrOgB&ip=78.16.131.161&id=o-AC9CCFvyKnF8kWAgMufo7GJhm_Y1x5qpnLiOkeVqmY-W&itag=140&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&mh=Dj&mm=31%2C29&mn=sn-xn5ucu-q0cz%2Csn-q0c7rn7d&ms=au%2Crdu&mv=m&mvi=3&pcm2cms=yes&pl=21&initcwndbps=1897500&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&ns=Tu5wibi7eUqqgyXUtsHSGR8L&gir=yes&clen=24028152&otfp=1&dur=1512.872&lmt=1386797552715705&mt=1676857259&fvip=1&keepalive=yes&fexp=24007246&c=WEB&n=-D-0zVZ4zBbw2A&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cns%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cotfp%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AOq0QJ8wRQIhAITKBF7GLk8RyCxfm5O0KEgdGEW1rtqMloQEmTt97KCeAiBZ5SZwfHeehYN_GDxJe8av8t0Z1lWJvEpy5n9D1-gFtg%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpcm2cms%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=AG3C_xAwRAIgOhTId8R6moaSA89uMBbjEtHs78YTGuXh1mE25g-04QsCIEHQlBktHl1Onv_GlLE8E4vuZGt3jSNfNmwzvCqxuXDG","audioBitrate":128}}
